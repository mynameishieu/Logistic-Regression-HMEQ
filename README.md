# Logistic Regression model - Home Equity dataset (HMEQ)
A project from Kaggle to explore a dataset concerning the loan status on a home equity line of credit.

**About Dataset**
**Context**
The consumer credit department of a bank wants to automate the decisionmaking process for approval of home equity lines of credit. To do this, they will follow the recommendations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to create an empirically derived and statistically sound credit scoring model. The model will be based on data collected from recent applicants granted credit through the current process of loan underwriting. The model will be built from predictive modeling tools, but the created model must be sufficiently interpretable to provide a reason for any adverse actions (rejections).

**Content**
The Home Equity dataset (HMEQ) contains baseline and loan performance information for 5,960 recent home equity loans. The target (BAD) is a binary variable indicating whether an applicant eventually defaulted or was seriously delinquent. This adverse outcome occurred in 1,189 cases (20%). For each applicant, 12 input variables were recorded, including:
BAD: 1 = client defaulted on loan 0 = loan repaid
LOAN: Amount of the loan request
MORTDUE: Amount due on existing mortgage
VALUE: Value of current property
REASON: DebtCon = debt consolidation HomeImp = home improvement
JOB: Six occupational categories
YOJ: Years at present job
DEROG: Number of major derogatory reports
DELINQ: Number of delinquent credit lines
CLAGE: Age of oldest trade line in months
NINQ: Number of recent credit lines
CLNO: Number of credit lines
DEBTINC: Debt-to-income ratio
